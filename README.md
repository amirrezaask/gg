# gg
A simple tool to generate code based on pre defined templates.
[https://amirrezaask.github.io/gg/](Web Version)
# Why
This tool is probably simplest thing i have ever written, but it is a really important component in my dev workflow.
Any code that i feel i am writing twice or in future i am gonna need it again i just add it to this repo then i can generate it again
using either the cli or web version.

# Templates
All templates are in mustache syntax.
